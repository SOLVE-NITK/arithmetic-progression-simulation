# arithmetic-progression-simulation
Concept: An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.  
# Formula:  a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1) * d 
- a<sub>n</sub> is the n<sup>th</sup> term
- a<sub>1</sub> is the 1<sup>st</sup> term
- d is the common difference
- n is the position of term in the sequence

Simulation:

Visualization: Create a line graph where the x-axis represents the term number n and the y-axis represents the term value a<sub>n</sub>
Interactive Controls:
First Term (a<sub>1</sub>): A slider to change the value of the first term.
Common Difference (d): A slider to adjust the common difference.
Number of Terms (n): A slider to increase or decrease the number of terms displayed.
What to Show:
Term Calculation: Display the value of each term as n increases.
Sum of Terms: Optionally, include the cumulative sum of the sequence, showing how the sum changes as more terms are added.
Interactive Example:

Suppose 
ùëé<sub>1</sub> = 2 
and 
d=3. The sequence would be 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...
The simulation would show these values appearing one by one, with the graph steadily rising as n increases.
